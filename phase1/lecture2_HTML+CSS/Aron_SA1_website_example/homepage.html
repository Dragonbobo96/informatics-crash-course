      <p>My name in Aron Dalle Pezze. I'm a 20 years old Swiss Cosplayer who studies Informatics at USI.
        <br>
        In this site, I'll talk you about my greatest passions, which are the four that you can also see on the
        navigation bar and at the bottom of this page.
        <br>
        <br>
        In 2008, I started to watch animes and to read mangas, and through youtube I finished to partecipate in a
        "forum" about those. Unfortunately, in 2010 that site was closed, so I created a new one with a friend on mine:
        "Anime/GDR Club!", which is the first topic of this website.
        <br>
        <br>
        Lately, in 2011, I started cosplaying, even if I don't really remember the reason. After that first cosplay of
        mine, I completely dropped cosplay for many years, but then I refound the passion some years ago and started
        all over again, taking it much more seriously.
        <br>
        <br>
        For what concerns videogames, I played since a I was 4/5 years old, so it's surley my oldest passion. For many
        years I played them just because they were funny and for nearly no other reason, but when I was in the second
        half of middle school I started to gain much more interest in them. So, I slowly began to study videogames more
        and to analize and criticize them evaluating many aspects, such as character designs, world design,
        soundtracks, story, gameplay, replayability and so on. Few years later, I also started to gain interest in the
        economy of videogames, which lead me to reasearch more about the software houses and to follow announces and
        conferences.
        <br>This passion of mine, is also the main reason for which I decided to study Informatics: become a game
        developer.
        <br>
        <br>
        Finally, animes and mangas. There is not really many things to say about this topic, since I already talked
        about this when explaining the birth of Anime/GDR Club. Even so, I'll just say that similarly to videogames,
        I've watched many animes (more than a hundred) and started to analize them as well, even if I'm completely not
        as good as with videogames.
        <br>
        <br>
        Thus said, if you're interested in deepen one of those argument, you can find all the four of them here:
